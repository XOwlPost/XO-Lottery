# XO-Lottery
Welcome to XO-Lottery, a unique and innovative project that combines the thrill of a lottery system with the power of blockchain technology. This project is a part of the larger ∞XO∞ ecosystem, aiming to create a vibrant and engaging community through shared experiences and rewards.

XO-Lottery is not just a simple lottery system. With every ticket purchase, participants are rewarded with a unique GenesisHashed NFT, each representing a piece of the ∞XO∞ universe. These NFTs are not just digital assets, but pieces of art, stories, and parts of our shared journey.

The lottery system is designed to be fair and transparent, with the chances of winning increasing based on the number of tickets purchased. The prize? A chance to shape the future of the ∞XO∞ universe and leave your mark on our shared digital destiny.

This repository contains the smart contract for the XO-Lottery system, as well as a web interface for users to buy tickets and interact with the contract. The contract is written in Solidity and can be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

We invite you to explore the code, participate in the lottery, and join us in crafting a new digital era. Welcome to ∞XO∞. The future is waiting.
